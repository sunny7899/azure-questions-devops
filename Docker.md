Code and local development storage. it is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy and run applications by using the container. it is a collection of PAAS (platform-as-a-service ) that uses OS level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. Containers are important for enhancing security, scalability and reproducibility in software development and data science.

Containers are hugely helpful for improving security, reproducibility, and scalability in software development

Docker is a platform to develop, deploy, and running applications inside containers. Docker is essentially synonymous with containerization

With Docker, you can run multiple containers simultaneously on a host machine. And like other software programs, Docker containers can be run, inspected, stopped, and deleted.

Virtual Machines: precursors to Docker containers. Virtual machines also isolate an application and its dependencies

Docker images are more like blueprints, cookie cutters, or molds. Images are the immutable master template that is used to pump out containers that are all exactly alike.

An image contains the Dockerfile, libraries, and code your application needs to run, all bundled together.

A Dockerfile is a file with instructions for how Docker should build your image.

The Dockerfile refers to a base image that is used to build the initial image layer.

Docker Container

A Docker image plus the command docker run image_name creates and starts a container from an image.
