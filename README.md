It is basically a collaboration tool that helps in the interaction between the development and operation team to deploy code to production faster in an automated & repeatable way. DevOps stands for development and operation.

It helps to increase an organizations speed to deliver application and services. So, it is a better way of communication and collaborating things. They Analyse the whole process of deployment when something bad happens. They help to increase the fast delivery of software.

DevOps is essentially about streamlining the development lifecycle to deliver products faster with better quality. It involves CI/CD, automation, cloud computing, and a lot more in order to bring cohesion and trust between developers and system admins.
DevOps = developers & testers + IT operations
Before DevOps people spend more time on testing, deploying and designing instead of building the project. Testing and deployment were isolated activities before the DevOps. It is important to automate all the testing processes and configure them to gain speed and agility. This process is known as DevOps automation.

A DevOps engineer will work with development team staff to tackle the coding and scripting needed to connect elements of code, like libraries or software development packages. DevOps is the most trending profession. QA team use tools like selenium, WonderProxy to know and fix bugs in the new piece of code.

In this, you can version everything so that the earlier version can be restored anytime. In this, you mostly work on terminal and Bash scripts.

It is used for large distributed applications such as e-commerce sites or applications hosted on the cloud.

It allows agile development teams to implement continuous integration and delivery.  


DevOps lifecycle-
Test- build- code- release-deploy-plan-monitor-operate



The challenge faced in large DevOps Team that maintain large huge IT infrastructure can be classified briefly into six different categories:

1-Infrastructure automation-

AWS

2-Configuration management-

Chef: Tool for achieving speed, scale and consistency.

3-Deployment automation-

Jenkins: Facilitates continuous integration and testing.

with Jenkins, we can deploy build or code. for this you just need to pass the branch name then the code will be deployed.

4- System Performance management-

App dynamic: Offers real-time performance monitoring to help the developer debug when an issue occurs.

5-Log management-

Splunk: analyze all logs in one place.

6- process Monitoring-

Nagios: when service goes down then it will notify to team and they can quickly correct this.



Tools and technologies DevOps engineers must aware of-

1- OS:

it used oAuth 2.0 It includes authentication, authorization and auditing.

Authentication determines who you are, authorization determines what you can do, and auditing logs what you did.

Colocation
Linode
Managed Hosting
OpenStack
OVH
VMware

3-  Automation-

Terraform, CFEngine, Packer, AWS cloud formation, PowerShell, SAIL DevOps, Chef, Ansible, Puppet.

In Amazon Web Services(AWS) learn Elastic Beanstalk(used to run the app), EC2, RDS, S3, ElastiCache, cloud front, VPC(virtual private cloud), route 53, SNS(simple notification service), lambda, Amazon API Gateway, code deploy,Nuclio, SQS .



4- Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, (CI/CD) Tools-

Jenkins/cloud bees, Travis, Drone, Bamboo, GitHub actions, Ionic app flow, Microsoft app centre,  Gitlab CI, AWA code pipeline(physical or cloud machine), Travis CI, Azure DevOps, Circle Ci, Bitbucket pipeline, 

buddy build-

continuous integration and delivery software for Git developers that can be used to build, test and deploy 


5- Containers-

Docker, RKT(Rocket), LXC(Linux Containers)



6- web servers-

Apache, Tomcat, Caddy, 

IIS (Internet Information Server)-
It is one of the most powerful web servers from Microsoft that is used to host ASP.NET web applications. It has its ASP.NET Process to handle ASP.NET requests.

Nginx –
It is an open-source reverse proxy server for HTTP, HTTPS, SMTP, IMAP, pop3 protocols. it is pronounced as engine-x. It’s a popular web and HTTP server.


7- Back-end web server and database-

Nginx, MySQL, Amazon Cloud etc.



They also have knowledge of setting up a

reverse proxy(Nginx)
caching server( Squid, Nginx)
load balancer (HAProxy, Nginx)
firewall
nano servers


8- cluster managers-

Kubernetes, mesosphere, Mesos, Docker swarm, Nomad



9- log management and analysis-

papertraill, ELK, Graylog, Splunk



10- process monitoring and alerting-

App dynamic, Nagios, new relic, Pagerduty, Munin, graphite, Zabbix, Prometheus, compiling apps from source (GCC)



11- ext editors-

Vim, eMACS



12- Network knowledge-

OSI model TCP/Ip/UDP Common ports TLS, STARTTLS, SSL, HTTPS, SCP, SSH, SFTP



13- knowledge about the different file systems.



14- Text manipulation

A server is a system that provides data to other computers. It used to provide the network connection. It serves the system on a LAN, WAN, MAN. There are various types of the server which provide services such as hosting websites, protecting internal networks, serving emails etc. The server provides service to another computer program and its user known as the client.

Dedicated server-
A dedicated server is a single computer in a network reserved for serving the needs of the network. For example, some networks require that one computer be set apart to manage communications between all the other computers.

A dedicated hosting service or managed hosting service is a type of Internet hosting in which the client leases an entire server not shared with anyone else.

Dedicated Server bandwidth-

In computer systems, Internet Service Providers (ISP) typically define bandwidth as a data transfer rate.

Clearly, it is the amount of data that the network can transport from one area to another during a particular timeframe

Bandwidth is expressed in cycles per second, or Hertz (Hz). 

The higher your bandwidth, the more people can visit your site at the same time and fully enjoy the peak experience you created for them.

Bandwidth Needed = Daily visitors x Daily page views x Average page size x 31 x Tolerance number.

The bandwidth of the server must be between 775mbps to 1 Gbps to run your system smooth.

Mail server-
Outgoing mail servers use the SMTP protocol. The DNS firstly communicate with the sender's SMTP server.

Incoming mail servers- POP3, IMAP

Ping-

The ping is the reaction time of your connection–how fast you get a response after you've sent out a request. A fast ping means a more responsive connection, especially in applications where timing is everything (like video games). Ping is measured in milliseconds (ms).


Download speed-

The download speed is how fast you can pull data from the server to you. Most connections are designed to download much faster than they upload, since the majority of online activity, like loading web pages or streaming videos, consists of downloads. Download speed is measured in megabits per second (Mbps).


Upload speed-

The upload speed is how fast you send data from you to others. Uploading is necessary for sending big files via email or using video chat to talk to someone else online (since you have to send your video feed to them). Upload speed is measured in megabits per second (Mbps).

The upload rate is always lower than the download rate.
